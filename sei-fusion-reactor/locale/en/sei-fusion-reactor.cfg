[entity-name]
fusion-reactor=Fusion reactor
fusion-generator=Fusion generator

[entity-description]
fusion-reactor=Uses thermofluid with fusion power cells to make plasma.
fusion-generator=Consumes plasma to create electric energy.

[fluid-name]
fusion-plasma=Plasma

[fluid-description]
fusion-plasma=Ultra-high-temperature ions generated in [entity=fusion-reactor] and consumed by a [entity=fusion-generator]. It is not a normal fluid and cannot be moved in [entity=pipe], it can only be moved through the Fusion reactor and Fusion generator.\nThe temperature of plasma determines its energy value.\nA quantity of plasma also represents that amount of coolant that travels with it, and the heated coolant is output by the Fusion generator as the plasma is used for energy.

[recipe-name]
flash-coolant-cold=Flash thermofluid cooling

[recipe-description]
flash-coolant-cold=An inefficient cooling method to cool [fluid=se-space-coolant-hot] into [fluid=se-space-coolant-cold] for use with fusion reactors.

[item-name]
fusion-power-cell=Fusion power cell

[technology-name]
fusion-reactor=Fusion reactor

[technology-description]
fusion-reactor=The dense plasma focus system allows us to create energy directly from the fusion reaction without the need to use steam engines.

[fuel-category-name]
fusion=Fusion fuel

[factoriopedia-description]
fusion-generator=Consumes plasma from the [entity=fusion-reactor] to create electric energy. Power production is nominal, but less plasma is consumed if the temperature is higher. It outputs heated coolant equal to the amount of plasma consumed that can be cooled in an [entity=cryogenic-plant] or [entity=se-space-hypercooler]. Fusion generators can be linked and transfer plasma to each other.
fusion-reactor=Uses fluoroketone coolant with fusion power cells to make super-heated plasma. It can only be output directly to an [entity=fusion-generator]. The neighbor bonus with other fusion reactors greatly increases the plasma temperature without increasing the amount of coolant used.
