fruits-processing=Geneticly modified seeds can be planted with [entity=agricultural-tower].\nThe yumako tree yields tasty nutritious fruit. Plant the seeds on yumako soil (yellow on map).\nThe jellystem yields gelatinous jellynuts. Plant the seeds on jellynut soil (magenta on map).
bioflux-processing=Using bioflux to get chemicals in a biological way.
carbon-fiber=Some plants naturally grow carbon nanotubes, which can be spun into fiber, and woven into extremely strong cloth.
carbon-fiber-robot-frame=Useing carbon fiber instead of steal to produce robot frames allow them to be lightweight and require less energy to fly.
fruits-proprocessing-vitalic-acid=Using vitalic acid to process the fruits allows you to extract more material out of them.
